Application and development of feature engineering pipelines to datasets from industry.

Use cases explored include popular datasets in the literature of these models, as well as the ones found in the sources. While we follow the general gist of specific chapters, we enrich each case under consideration by incorporating modern techniques from other sources as well as from personal, professional, and academic experience.
